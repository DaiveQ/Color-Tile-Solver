# Color Tile Solver
## Currently greedy and likely won't 100% clear

Solver for the Color Tile game found here Solver the the Color Tile game on [gamesaien](https://www.gamesaien.com/game/color_tiles/)

Very haphazardly thrown together with intent of beating the game so I can stop playing it

# Usage
1. Start program (with dependencies installed)
1. Hover over upper left of playable area of grid and press backtick/tilda key (\'/~ key)
1. Hover over bottom right of playable area of grid and press backtick/tilda key
1. Don't touch mouse and let program solve
1. Press escape to stop program at any time (can continue from step 2 to restart solver without restarting program)

There are plans to make the solver 100% the game all the time (or at least consistently). After this, I may clean up the code (or not).
